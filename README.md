# Instagram Threads Web Client

This project provides a desktop web client for Threads. Meta is too slow to implement, so I'm working on it. Mobile is not the best experience to work with.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

Now you are presented with a login screen. Enter your credentials. Then you will see something like this:

## Roadmap

Right now this just displays the regular feed with likes and reply counts. It displays images and it displays video properly.

Todo:

1. ~~View threads~~
2. ~~View replies~~
3. ~~Add posting~~
4. ~~Add replying~~
5. View repost
6. Add liking
7. Add reposting
8. ???
